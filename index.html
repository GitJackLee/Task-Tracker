<!--
//Inversed navbar (black) that has the title of the site, login and register.
//If the user is logged in, their name shows in place of login, and logout shows in place of register.

//Create an unordered list, or ul. Using CSS, remove the lines.
//The ul should have a class of "tasks".
//Each item in the ul should have a span, with the class of "taskTimer".
//On the left of each ul task, there should be a span with "x" as the content. This will be used to delete the task.
//On the right of each task, there should be a button that allows you to continue the corresponding task.

//There should be a text input area above the stopwatch.
//The text input area should have a button to submit both the task name and time.
  //For example, text input: "Programming", time: "01h 30m 30s".
  //Pressing the submit button should append the task to a new ul.
