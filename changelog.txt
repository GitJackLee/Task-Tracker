- Major changes
  - Decided to go with REST api. Completely changed how everything looks.
  - Using Semantic UI framework.
  - Reduced the amount of jquery. Plan on changing it so it's not needed at all.

- Timer
  - Able to
    - Create new task
    - Edit the name of a task. I decided against being able to edit the time itself.
    - Click the save button to save the time. Timer does not update automatically on pause. Must save.
      - Save redirects to page. Plan to add a message upon saving that notifies user the update was successful.
    - Able to reset to zero. Like mentioned above. Must save in order to keep changes.

- Home page
  - Currently, upon starting app.js everything deletes from the database, and is seeded with predefined data. This is for development purposes.
  - View all created tasks.
  - Timer on each task that tells the user when it was originally created.
  - Able to start task and delete only. To edit, you must go to each individual task.
